    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>
      Ask Don Moen what he does, and the answer might surprise you. He won’t say
      he’s a songwriter even though he’s written more than 100 songs. He won’t
      say he’s a worship leader even though he’s led worship on every continent
      but Antarctica and recorded numerous albums. He won’t say he’s a
      businessman or producer even though he has produced and directed hundreds
      of successful projects. If you ask Don Moen why God put him on this
      planet, he’ll tell you, “To be an architect who designs products and
      events that help people experience God’s presence in a new and fresh way.”
      And in more than three decades of ministry, he’s had lots of opportunity
      to fulfill that purpose.  His discography reflects his passion to create
      resources for the church that lead people into an honest and intimate
      relationship with the Lord. In 2002, his peers recognized that lifelong
      commitment and presented him with the Ray DeVries Church Ministry Award.
